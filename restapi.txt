BEST PRACTICES:-
1. Always follow server-client Architecture.
2. Always respect all http methods.
//ppl generally update, delete, create things all by post but why if they have specified methods for them, they use routes POST /update, POST /createUser, GET /getuser if you have methods you don't need routes and use method of that particular operation.
